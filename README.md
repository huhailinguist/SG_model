# SG_model
Sentence Gestalt model code and modeling outputs (Rabovsky, Hansen, &amp; McClelland, NHB, 2018).
This is the code to train and test the Sentence Gestalt model and to analyze the modeling outputs. Modeling outputs are also made available. 
Please contact me (milena.rabovsky@gmail.com), if you would like to use the code. I have made everything available, but plan to still clean the code before others use it.
Thank you!
